## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, one problem I encountered is that by using the api link provided in the website, the quote was staying the same even if I reloaded the page or clicked on the dice icon. To solve this, I used the link where the user can input a number ID and it returns the corresponding code. So I added a random number generator on the beggining of the code to generate a number between 1 and 220 (which seems to be the highest number the site accepts) and added this number to the link so that now the quote changes everytime the user clicks on the button.
